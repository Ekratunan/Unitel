similar taxes due. If Licensor is required to pay any such amounts, Licensee shall reimburse
Licensor in full.
3. COPIES
 Licensee may make copies of the Licensed Program in executable code form as
necessary for use by Licensee and for backup or archive purposes. Licensee agrees to maintain
records of the location and use of each copy, in whole or in part, of the Licensed Programs. Each

otherwise make available in any form the Licensed Programs, or any portion thereof, to any
person other than employees of Licensee without the prior written consent of NEAR. Licensee
further agrees to treat the Licensed Programs with at least the same degree of care with which
Licensee treats its own confidential information and in no event with less care than is reasonably

Section 7 hereof and subject to Licensee's proper performance of its obligations hereunder.

conditions of this Agreement and fails to correct such default within ten (10) days after written
notice thereof from NEAR.
8. TERMINATION CERTIFICATE
 In the event of termination, Licensee will immediately discontinue use of the
Licensed Programs. Within one (1) month after termination of this Agreement, Licensee will
furnish to NEAR a certificate which certifies with respect to each of the Licensed Programs that,
through its best effort and to the best of its knowledge, the original and all copies, in whole or in
part and in any form, of each of the Licensed Programs have been destroyed. The provisions of
Sections 4, 5, 8, 11, and 13 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
9. MAINTENANCE SUPPORT
 Licensor will provide to Licensee the following support with respect to the Software:
 (i) If during the 1st year of this Agreement, Licensee notifies Licensor of a
substantial program error respecting the Software, or Licensor has reason to believe that error
exists in the Software and so notifies Licensee, Licensor shall at its expense verify and attempt to
correct such error within thirty (30) working days after the date of notification. If Licensee is not 
satisfied with the correction, then Licensee may terminate this Agreement, but without refund of
any amount paid to Licensor or release of any amounts due Licensor at the time of termination.

Licensee shall pay to Licensor the maintenance fee(s) set forth in Exhibit A.
10. DELIVERY OF LICENSED PROGRAMS
 NEAR shall use its best efforts to deliver the Licensed Programs promptly after
receipt of the purchase order and export license (if required).
11. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
 NEAR licenses, and Licensee accepts, the licensed programs "AS IS." NEAR
PROVIDES NO WARRANTIES AS TO THE FUNCTION OR USE OF THE LICENSED
PROGRAMS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PROGRAM IS WITH LICENSEE. LICENSOR DOES
NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE LICENSED PROGRAMS
WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE
LICENSED PROGRAMS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.
12. PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITY
 NEAR will defend at its own expense any action brought against Licensee to the
extent it is based on a claim that the Licensed Programs used within the scope of the license
granted hereunder infringe a United States patent, copyright or other proprietary right of a third
party. NEAR will pay any costs, damages or attorney fees finally awarded against Licensee in
such action which are attributable to such claim, provided NEAR is promptly notified in writing
of such claim, may control the defense and/or settlement of such claim, and is provided with all
requested assistance, information and authority. In the event that a Licensed Program becomes,
or in NEAR's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of a United
States patent, copyright or trade secret, NEAR may at its option either secure Licensee's right to
continue using the Licensed Programs, replace or modify the Licensed Programs to make them
not infringing, or provide Licensee with a refund of the license fee less depreciation on a 5 (five)
year, straight-line basis. NEAR shall have no liability for any claim of patent, copyright or trade
secret infringement based on the use of a Licensed Program in any form other than the original,
unmodified form provided to Licensee or the use of a combination of the Licensed Programs 
with hardware, software or data not supplied by NEAR where the used Licensed Programs alone
in their original, unmodified form would not constitute an infringement. The foregoing states
Licensee's entire liability for infringement or claims of infringement of patents, copyrights or
other intellectual property right.
13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 NEAR'S LIABILITY TO LICENSEE UNDER ANY PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT FOR DAMAGES FINALLY AWARDED SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID HEREUNDER BY LICENSEE TO NEAR. IN NO EVENT

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR
INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, HOWEVER CAUSED OR ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY.

unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in force as if such provision were
not a part.
